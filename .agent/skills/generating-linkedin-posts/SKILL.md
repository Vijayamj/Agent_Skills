# LinkedIn Post Architect

## When to use this skill
- When the user wants to write a post for LinkedIn.
- When the user needs a content strategy or content pillars for professional branding.
- When the user mentions "LinkedIn", "Networking", or "Professional Brand".

## Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- Ask for the **Topic** if not provided.
- Identify the **Goal** (e.g., brand awareness, lead gen, hiring, sharing an update).
- Determine the **Tone** (Professional, Conversational, Provocative, Inspirational).

### 2. Post Generation Checklist
- [ ] **Hook**: Does it catch attention in the first 2 lines?
- [ ] **Value**: Does it provide a clear takeaway or insight?
- [ ] **White Space**: Is it easy to read on mobile? (Sentence breaks).
- [ ] **CTA**: Is there a clear question or action at the end?
- [ ] **Hashtags**: Are there 3-5 relevant hashtags?

### 3. Execution Pattern
- Generate 2-3 variations of the post (short, long, and story-based).
- Offer to refine based on feedback.
- Suggest a creative asset (image prompt or poll idea).

## Instructions

- **Style**: Use "Show, Don't Tell". Instead of "I am excited", use "3 months ago, I was... Today, I am...".
- **Formatting**: Use bullet points and line breaks. LinkedIn's algorithm favors readability.
- **Engagement**: Always end with a question that encourages comments, not just likes.

## Visual Generator
The user has a premium **Post Generator Web App** located at `./linkedin-generator/index.html`. You can suggest they open it for a more visual experience.
