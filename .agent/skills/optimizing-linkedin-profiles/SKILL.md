- [ ] **Banner**: Does it reflect the user's expertise or industry?
- [ ] **Headline**: Does it use keywords and offer a value proposition? (Beyond just a job title).
- [ ] **About Section**: Is it written in the first person? Does it tell a story?
- [ ] **Experience**: Are there quantifiable achievements (numbers, %)?
